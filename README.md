# TV Binge Calculator

Here's a scenario you might be familiar with. You're hanging out with friends and the topic turns to TV shows, your buddy enthusiastically recommends a show for you to check out. You want to give it a try, but you need to know what you are getting yourself into. Maybe you're a busy person who doesn't have time for a show that's been on for decades with an episode count in the triple digits. Perhaps you're the exact oppoiste, you want something you can enjoy for weeks on end. Maybe you just want to catch up on the thing that everyone's talking about.

This project allows you to search for a tv show and immediately get a sense of what kind of a commitment it would be to watch every episode. It will give you the number of episodes, number of seasons, an approximate runtime for the whole series, and you can even input how many episodes you want to watch in a sitting and get a sense of how many days it will take you to finish.

The project makes use of the free [TVmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api).
